## Background

This is not a topic I really want to have to discuss at all, in part because my thoughts on it will probably just upset people on either side of the arguments. Let's maybe just start by getting some basic things out of the way first:

- I currently own a 2022 Tesla Model 3 LR AWD, manufactured in November of 2021.
- I bought it used with 5k miles on it from a Toyota dealership in Buffalo, NY in June of 2022.
- I still owe money on it, about $25k, and it will be paid off in June 2027.
- The car's estimated value is only about $20k per Kelley Blue Book, but last time I tried to trade it in I was offered about $5k less than KBB estimated.
- I have been driving EVs almost exclusively since 2017, starting with a 2015 Nissan LEAF.
- EVs are possibly my biggest (certainly most expensive) hobbies.
- My energy is cheap ($0.05 per kwh) and sourced from Niagara Falls hydro (therefore zero emissions).
  - Notably Niagara Falls is not a dam, the main flow of water is not impeded like with most hydro power.
- The Tesla Model 3 is the most sold EV in the US, and is [still #2 behind the Model Y in new sales in 2024](https://electrek.co/2025/01/14/top-10-best-selling-evs-us-2024/).
- In 2021, the Model 3 was the most American car per cars.com, and was [second after the Model Y in 2022](https://www.cars.com/articles/2022-cars-com-american-made-index-which-cars-are-the-most-american-451057/)
- The Model 3 is [one of the most efficient EVs](https://www.cars.com/articles/top-10-most-efficient-electric-cars-447501/) with over 200 miles of range (looking at you old IONIQ EV), after the IONIQ 6 and Lucid Air.

## My Preferences

I am not beholden to a particular brand like many people are. In terms of EVs I have owned a 2015 Nissan LEAF, (leased) a 2019 Tesla Model 3 SR+, a 2021 Ford Mustang Mach E SR AWD, and now a 2022 Tesla Model 3 LR AWD. For traditional ICE cars I've also had a 2002 Honda Civic LX (2013-2017) and a 1991 Mazda Miata (2018-2019). If I had to pick a new car right this instant, my first choices (EV or not, limited to things you can actually buy in the US) would probably be the Hyundai IONIQ 5, Kia EV6, or Rivian R1T. I still like the Model 3 refresh and the Model Y refresh, though the choices available now in the market are compelling.

When possible, I like to buy cars that are built in the US. I am not at all against vehicles built elsewhere, excepting that I would probably avoid ones built primarily in China but wouldn't count them out entirely. I am into technology, so vehicles with regular software updates, autonomous driving features, and attempts to redefine the driving experience are all things that I like. I am the type of person who does not like having a bunch of single-use buttons in my car, especially ones on the wheel that I will probably never use. That was the main reason I swapped the Mach E back for a Model 3, plus the SR Mach E with a resistive heater in Upstate NY winter while driving 300 miles regularly was a bit of a hassle, but we'll get back to that.

As alluded in the previous paragraph, I live in Rochester, NY,  one of the snowiest cities in America, though our winters are mostly snowy and only moderately cold (rarely below 20F but most days don't go above 40F). I also regularly drive from Rochester to Cleveland, OH, especially around the winter holidays, which is about 300 miles one-way. That's usually one stop in my current car, and two or more in the Mach E SR that also each took longer because it charged slower. I have also driven trips like Nashville, TN back to Rochester in a single day, which requires a decent charging network. When I had the Mach E, Electrify America was acceptable but not good in my experience, while the Supercharger network was pretty much flawless. Despite ranges being similar in my Model 3 SR+ and the Mach E, the trip was significantly easier in the Model 3.

So far this has really just been me justifying why the Model 3 works very well for me as a vehicle. I do not want to get rid of this car. It is more environmentally friendly for me to drive it into the dirt than it is to get a new car. I enjoy driving it, I would feel comfortable driving it across the country, and I enjoy using the Supervised Full Self Driving features (even if I do not have any faith that my car will be able to do anything unsupervised) especially on road trips because it makes driving for hours at a time far less exhausting. Buying used means I didn't give any money to Tesla, the only money I have given them so far is the $100 a year for premium connectivity. Since it's Hardware 3, I will at some point cost them money if/when they upgrade it to HW4.

## Elon Musk

The real reason you're probably reading this. Let me say this straight as an owner and investor of Tesla: I like Tesla the company, but I do not think that Elon Musk is the person who should continue as CEO. I have had issues with Musk as a person since the "pedo guy" incident in 2018, which made it very clear that he's an egotistical jerk. Being a jerk doesn't necessarily mean you're bad at running a company, in fact it seems like it might be a requirement if you go off of many other examples. He's not the smartest guy, he's socially a nightmare, but he's demonstrated an ability to get the right people together to make innovative ideas actually happen. Not ever in the time frame he claims, but some truly amazing stuff has been accomplished by Tesla and SpaceX.

But the mission of Tesla that I have been a fan of, accelerating the world's transition to sustainable transport/energy, is not the company's focus anymore, and clearly not the focus of Musk. Actively promoting the removal of the EV tax credits which have both promoted EV adoption and caused automakers to invest in US factories, buying Twitter with Tesla funds so it will allow the dissemination of misinformation (deliberate and unintentional), and pivoting Tesla from an EV/energy company to automation and robotics, are all either misaligned with or actively oppositional to Tesla's primary mission.
